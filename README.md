## 🛠️ Local Development

### Prerequisites

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/) (extended version recommended)
- Git

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/utkarshjosh/utkarshjoshi.git
   cd utkarshjoshi
   ```

2. **Install Hugo** (if not already installed)
   ```bash
   # On macOS with Homebrew
   brew install hugo
   
   # On Linux
   sudo apt-get install hugo
   
   # Or download from https://gohugo.io/installation/
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   hugo server -D
   ```

4. **View the site**
   Open [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313) in your browser

### Building for Production

```bash
# Generate static site
hugo

# Output will be in the `public/` directory
```

## 📝 Adding Content

### Adding a New Project

1. Create a new markdown file in `content/projects/`:
   ```bash
   hugo new projects/my-new-project.md
   ```

2. Edit the front matter with project details:
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: "My New Project"
   date: 2024-01-01
   draft: false
   description: "Project description"
   image: "images/projects/project-image.png"
   tags: ["React", "Node.js"]
   github: "https://github.com/username/repo"
   demo: "https://demo-url.com"
   blog: "/posts/my-project-blog-post"
   ---
   ```

### Adding a New Blog Post

1. Create a new markdown file in `content/posts/`:
   ```bash
   hugo new posts/my-blog-post.md
   ```

2. Write your content in Markdown format

## 🚢 Deployment

The site is automatically deployed to AWS EC2 via GitHub Actions whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

### Deployment Process

1. **Push to main branch** triggers the workflow
2. **GitHub Actions** runs the deployment workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
3. **AWS SSM** executes commands on EC2 instance:
   - Pulls latest code from GitHub
   - Runs `deploy.sh` script
   - Builds Hugo site
   - Syncs `public/` directory to `/var/www/portfolio`

### Manual Deployment

If you need to deploy manually:

```bash
# On the EC2 instance
cd /path/to/project
git pull origin main
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

## 🎨 Customization

### Custom CSS

Edit `assets/css/extended/custom.css` to add custom styles. These will be automatically included in the build.

### Theme Modifications

The site uses a modified version of Paper Mod. Custom layouts are in the `layouts/` directory:
- `layouts/_default/about.html` - Custom about page
- `layouts/_default/projects.html` - Custom projects listing
- `layouts/partials/extend_head.html` - Additional head elements

### Configuration

Main configuration is in `hugo.yaml`. Key settings:
- Site metadata and SEO
- Menu structure
- Social media links
- Theme parameters
- Google Analytics
