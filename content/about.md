I'm a software engineer with 3+ years of experience building and owning products end-to-end in fast-paced startup environments. Working directly with founders and business stakeholders, I learned to think in terms of real problems, outcomes, and long-term product health—not just tasks. I care about designing durable systems: clear contracts, strong patterns, and architectures that evolve cleanly over the full software lifecycle.

Along the way, I've developed a deep adaptability muscle. I began with JavaScript, Vue, and Node; built Ethereum crypto bridges; moved into the TON/Telegram ecosystem and shipped a production-grade Golang transaction server; implemented a Polymarket-style trading engine in under three weeks; and even delivered features in Unity. My work spans multiple stacks and domains, and I've consistently learned new technologies on the fly to support business goals.

Beyond features, I've driven platform-level changes—most notably migrating a full B2B SaaS product into a modern API-first platform. More recently, I've been focused on AI: building internal agents that plug directly into our CRM, automating workflows, and exploring generative UI to create intrinsically AI-integrated, dynamic, user-adaptive applications.

I'm now looking for roles where product sense, platform thinking, and technical versatility matter as much as the code itself—environments where I can own problems end-to-end and help push teams toward cleaner architecture, faster iteration, and higher-impact solutions.
