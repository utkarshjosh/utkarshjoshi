A deep dive into building **Citations**, a TikTok-style research paper discovery platform that transforms dense academic content into addictive, swipeable experiences using cutting-edge agentic AI workflows.

## The Problem: Research Discovery is Broken

Academic research discovery suffers from a fundamental UX problem. Traditional platforms like arXiv, PubMed, and Google Scholar present research papers as dense, text-heavy lists that overwhelm users. The barrier to entry is too high - researchers need to parse through technical abstracts, understand complex terminology, and invest significant time just to determine if a paper is relevant.

**The statistics are staggering:**

- Average researcher spends 23% of their time just searching for relevant papers
- 87% of research papers receive fewer than 10 citations
- Academic papers have a 0.1% read completion rate beyond the abstract

We set out to solve this by making research discovery as engaging and addictive as TikTok, while maintaining the depth and accuracy that researchers need.

## The Solution: Agentic AI-Powered Research Discovery

Citations transforms the research discovery experience through three core innovations:

1. **TikTok-Style Interface**: Single-card focus with vertical swipe navigation
2. **Agentic AI Processing**: Intelligent paper summarization and insight generation
3. **Mobile-First PWA**: Installable web app optimized for mobile consumption

## Architecture Deep Dive

### 1. Agentic AI Workflow with LangGraph

The heart of Citations is our **agentic paper processing pipeline** built with LangGraph. Here's how it works:

```python
# Our LangGraph workflow processes papers through 5 intelligent nodes
workflow = StateGraph(PaperProcessingState)

# Node 1: Ingestion & Validation
workflow.add_node("ingestion", validate_paper_input)

# Node 2: AI-Powered Summary Generation
workflow.add_node("summary", generate_plain_english_summary)

# Node 3: Impact Analysis
workflow.add_node("impact", analyze_why_it_matters)

# Node 4: Application Discovery
workflow.add_node("applications", identify_practical_use_cases)

# Node 5: Quality Validation
workflow.add_node("validation", validate_generated_content)
```

**Key Technical Decisions:**

- **Multi-LLM Support**: We support both Gemini and Groq models for redundancy and cost optimization
- **Structured Output**: Each node produces validated, structured data that feeds into the next
- **Error Handling**: Failed papers don't break the pipeline - we log errors and continue processing
- **Deduplication**: Smart duplicate detection prevents processing the same paper multiple times

### 2. Multi-Source Paper Discovery

We built a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration** that enables multi-source paper discovery:

```python
from paper_search_mcp.academic_platforms.arxiv import ArxivSearcher

class AgenticPaperFetcher:
    def __init__(self):
        self.searcher = ArxivSearcher()
        self.categories = ["cs.AI", "cs.LG", "cs.CV", "cs.CL", "cs.NE"]

    async def fetch_and_process_papers(self):
        papers = await self.searcher.search_by_category(
            categories=self.categories,
            max_results=50,
            days_back=1
        )
        return self._transform_papers(papers)
```

**Supported Sources:**

- **arXiv**: Primary source for CS/AI papers
- **PubMed**: Medical research (future)
- **SSRN**: Law/Finance papers (future)
- **Custom APIs**: Extensible for any research database

### 3. Modern Full-Stack Architecture

Our tech stack is optimized for performance and developer experience:

**Backend (Node.js + Express):**

```javascript
// High-performance feed API with pagination
app.get("/api/feed", async (req, res) => {
  const { page = 1, limit = 20, category, sort = "newest" } = req.query;

  const papers = await Paper.find(query)
    .sort(sortOptions[sort])
    .skip((page - 1) * limit)
    .limit(parseInt(limit))
    .lean();

  res.json({
    data: papers,
    pagination: { page, limit, total, hasMore },
  });
});
```

**Frontend (React + Vite + Mantine):**

```jsx
// TikTok-style swipe interface with Framer Motion
const SwipeableCard = ({ paper, onSwipe }) => {
  const controls = useAnimation();

  const handleSwipe = (direction) => {
    if (direction === "up") {
      controls.start({ y: -window.innerHeight, opacity: 0 });
      onSwipe("next");
    }
  };

  return (
    <motion.div
      animate={controls}
      drag="y"
      dragConstraints={{ top: 0, bottom: 0 }}
      onDragEnd={(_, info) => handleSwipe(info.offset.y < -100 ? "up" : "down")}
      className="paper-card">
      <PaperContent paper={paper} />
    </motion.div>
  );
};
```

**Database (MongoDB):**

```javascript
// Optimized schema with proper indexing
const paperSchema = new Schema({
  arxiv_id: { type: String, unique: true, index: true },
  title: String,
  authors: [String],
  summary: String, // AI-generated
  why_it_matters: String, // AI-generated
  applications: [String], // AI-generated
  category: { type: String, index: true },
  likes_count: { type: Number, default: 0, index: true },
  views_count: { type: Number, default: 0, index: true },
  created_at: { type: Date, default: Date.now, index: true },
});
```

## Key Features & Technical Implementation

### 1. Intelligent Paper Processing

Our AI workflow generates three types of content for each paper:

**Plain English Summary (3-5 lines):**

```
"This paper introduces a new approach to natural language processing that
eliminates the need for labeled training data. By using self-supervised
learning on massive text corpora, the model achieves state-of-the-art
performance on 11 NLP tasks without any task-specific fine-tuning."
```

**Why It Matters:**

```
"This breakthrough reduces the cost and complexity of building NLP systems,
making advanced language AI accessible to smaller organizations and
enabling rapid prototyping of new applications."
```

**Practical Applications:**

```
["Automated customer service chatbots", "Document summarization tools",
"Code generation assistants", "Educational content creation"]
```

### 2. TikTok-Style User Experience

We implemented a mobile-first, single-card interface that maximizes user engagement:

**Technical Features:**

- **Vertical Swipe Navigation**: Touch and drag gestures with momentum
- **Optimistic UI Updates**: Instant feedback for likes and interactions
- **Infinite Scroll**: Seamless content loading with intersection observer
- **PWA Support**: Install to home screen with offline capabilities
- **Smooth Animations**: 60fps transitions using Framer Motion

**Performance Optimizations:**

```javascript
// Intersection Observer for infinite scroll
const useInfiniteScroll = () => {
  const observerRef = useRef();
  const [cursor, setCursor] = useState(null);

  const { data, fetchNextPage, hasNextPage } = useInfiniteQuery({
    queryKey: ["papers", cursor],
    queryFn: ({ pageParam = null }) => fetchPapers(pageParam),
    getNextPageParam: (lastPage) => lastPage.pagination.nextCursor,
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    const observer = new IntersectionObserver(
      (entries) => {
        if (entries[0].isIntersecting && hasNextPage) {
          fetchNextPage();
        }
      },
      { threshold: 0.1 }
    );

    if (observerRef.current) observer.observe(observerRef.current);
    return () => observer.disconnect();
  }, [hasNextPage, fetchNextPage]);
};
```

### 3. Engagement Tracking & Analytics

We built a comprehensive engagement system that tracks user behavior without requiring authentication:

```javascript
// Session-based engagement tracking
class EngagementTracker {
  constructor() {
    this.sessionId = this.generateSessionId();
    this.likedPapers = this.loadFromStorage();
  }

  async trackLike(paperId) {
    // Optimistic UI update
    this.updateUI(paperId, "liked");

    try {
      await api.post(`/papers/${paperId}/like`);
      this.saveToStorage(paperId);
    } catch (error) {
      // Rollback on failure
      this.updateUI(paperId, "unliked");
    }
  }
}
```

## Deployment & Infrastructure

### Docker-First Development

We containerized everything for consistent development and deployment:
