A robust full-stack automation system designed to handle daily attendance tasks. This project combines the raw automation power of Puppeteer with the real-time capabilities of Firebase and the UI flexibility of Flutter.

## Key Features

- **Automated Sign-In**: Uses Puppeteer to mimic user interactions for daily attendance.
- **Mobile Control Center**: A Flutter app to monitor status and toggle configurations.
- **Real-Time Sync**: Uses Firebase Firestore to push updates from the app to the Node.js server instantly.
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Supports changing schedules, locations, and work modes on the fly.
