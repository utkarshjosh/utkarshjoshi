A high-energy, real-time quiz application designed for live competitions. This full-stack project enables users to create quizzes, host game sessions, and compete with friends in real-time, featuring instant scoring and dynamic leaderboards.

## Key Features

- **Live Multiplayer Sessions**: Join games instantly using a unique 6-digit PIN.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: WebSocket-powered communication for sub-second latency.
- **Dynamic Scoring**: Points awarded based on speed and accuracy, with streak bonuses.
- **Host Controls**: comprehensive dashboard for managing players and game flow.
- **Responsive Design**: Seamless experience across desktop and mobile devices.

I also documented my journey of setting up a [zero-cost CI/CD pipeline](/posts/free-docker-pipeline) for this application, covering everything from AWS Free Tier to Cloudflare DNS.
